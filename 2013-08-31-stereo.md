title: "The Stereo Is Dead. Long Live The Stereo."

A week ago I sat down in front of [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-receiver/) to try to buy a receiver. Here's their pick for best of breed receiver:

It's SIX INCHES TALL. It's not horifically ugly, but it sure isn't pretty. It has _every feature you can possibly imagine_. When I went looking for something smaller, I found **one company**, Marantz, [makes smaller a/v receivers](http://reviews.cnet.com/av-receivers/marantz-nr1403/4505-6466_7-35315284.html), and they're not even that small:

I really don't have that many requirements. I don't care about surround sound at all. [A pair of good stereo loudspeakers will do better than surrounding yourself with cheap ones](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13645_3-57602824-47/is-a-stereo-receiver-right-for-you/). Here's what I want: a bunch of HDMI inputs, some stereo inputs, and an amplifier for two speakers. A remote control. I already have an Apple TV, but I'd love it if it turned on when I tried to play music.

So then I went looking for something simpler. An amplifier with a couple digital and a couple analog inputs. [Hey, this looks pretty cool!](http://reviews.cnet.com/amplifiers-preamps-processors/nad-d-3020/4505-7871_7-35757056.html)

Except it's $500. It doesn't have _any_ HDMI inputs (it targets audiophiles), so I'd still have to deal with this crappy [switch](http://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-501BN-Premium-wireless-adapter/dp/B0049SCB2Y) that needs line of sight to a remote, because my TV doesn't have enough plugs.

Then I remembered I had heard people talking about this new breed of cheap automotive receivers with [surprisingly good sound quality for around **$20**.](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13645_3-57439115-47/build-your-own-desktop-stereo-for-under-$70/)

But there's no remote control at all. Kind of important for your TV sound. So then I started thinking.

Except it would suck. Enormously. No remote volume control, three power supplies, a pile of _crap_ on my entertainment console.

What if you threw in a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and some cheap hardware bits? There's a [whole **distro**](http://www.raspyfi.com/) for hi-fi audio through a Raspberry Pi. It supports Airplay out of the box. [It plays video too!](http://www.raspbmc.com/). There's an [infrared remote kit for it for $7](http://www.amazon.com/Kootek-Raspberry-Infrared-Control-Receiver/dp/B00COJ31YC). I could throw together a mobile app in a weekend. I bet you could sell a lot of these for $300. I bet you could even make it modular. Want more analog inputs? Buy some more analog inputs. Plug them in.

Why isn't anyone making this? [c\|net is already decrying the current generation of receivers.](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33199_7-57576681-221/how-to-save-the-av-receiver/) Sounds like I've got a project to start.
