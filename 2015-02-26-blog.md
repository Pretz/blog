title: A Blog Post About Setting Up A Blog
tags : [meta]
---

I've never been much of a blogger. I've had aspirations to start blogging many times, but never properly followed through. I've decided _this time is going to be different_.

I'm taking control of my own blog, on my own site, and making it as easy as possible to write. That means markdown, dropbox [^note], and one a line command to update. I've done a great job so far spending three weeks of sporadic free time messing with setup instead of writing anything.

[^note]: and footnotes

Over the years I've used [livejournal][lj], [tumblr][], [wordpress][], facebook, and twitter as "blogging" outlets, but never felt satisfied with any of them.

My first personal programming project _ever_, in 2007, was an attempt to build a blogging engine in Ruby on Rails that imported posts from livejournal, links from [del.icio.us][pleasepost], and photos from [flickr][]. It never really worked, certainly not well enough for me to direct anyone to it. It was far too ambitious for someone who barely knew how to program[^program].

[^program]: Let alone understood asynchronous web processes, multiple APIs, and the difference between rails Controllers and tasks.

Since then I kept thinking I should blog on a "real" site like wordpress.com, but only one person ever found my handful of posts. It was also a monumental task to get images, code, and notes organized to put into wordpress' formatting engine. It wasn't fun, so I never did it.

I've got a handful of technical things I want to talk about now (Swift!), and realized I need a single clear place to go when I _do_ want to write something.

### Nerd Stuff:
I set up a [skeleton of a blog][skel] ages ago using [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)[^defunct], but never touched it after the initial setup. I used it to stage [two paltry posts][posts] I put on wordpress after taking a stab at a [game jam][jam] with friend [Lily Cheng](http://roamingcuriosity.com).

I looked into a handful of static blog engines[^engines], but finally decided Jekyll did enough, but was small enough, that I would stick with it. The first order of business was to convert to bootstrap 3. I write mobile apps, priority 1 is my blog needs to be responsive. After a couple days of fiddling with bootstrap overrides and updating jekyllbootstrap's layouts for boostrap 3, I've got something I'm happy with for now.

`TODO: ` make a sample Jekyll config using Boostrap 3's sass files for easy overriding, [like this][blog-gh]. Also, [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), which both [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) and [bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com) require. Unfortunately this doesn't work with github pages.

I should also mention the tiny [Makefile][makefile] I wrote to simplify serving and uploading with some small config tweaks.
