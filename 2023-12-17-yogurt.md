Our family goes through a lot of yogurt. Early on in the pandemic we were going through 64 ounces of [Straus Yogurt](https://www.strausfamilycreamery.com/products/european-style-yogurt/) a week, which was expensive and really hard to keep stocked when we felt unsafe going to the grocery store.

Enter the Instant Pot.

I knew that theoretically one _could_ make yogurt in the instant pot. It turns out to be incredibly easy! It's also much cheaper and less wasteful than buying gallons of premium yogurt from Berkeley Bowl. So here's what I do to make a half gallon of yogurt most weeks:

Instant Pot Yogurt
-------------------------

#### Ingredients

*  ½ gallon whole milk (I use Clover Organic)
*  2 tb yogurt (store bought or homemade with an heirloom culture) [__see note__](#on-culture)

#### Equipment

Instant Pot, whisk, instant-read thermometer, glass jars or another container that can hold two quarts of yogurt.

#### Recipe

Start this either first thing in the morning or before going to bed at night.

**Total Time: 11.5 Hours**

1. Put the milk in the instant pot. If you're pouring from a 1 gallon jug, I pour to about 5mm below the 2 qt line so the resulting yogurt will fit nicely in two glass quart mason jars.
1. Close and lock the lid.
1. Set the instant pot to **Yogurt**: **Pasteurize**. The instant pot will warm and then hold the milk at 180°F for 3 minutes.

1. When the instant pot beeps that it's finished, pull out the inner pot and set it out to cool at room temperature. [^1]
1. Wait for the milk to reach 115° - 110° F. If it goes below 110°, reheat it on a very low stove burner. During this time a small skin may form on the milk. I usually skim it off with a fork and throw it in the compost.
1. Pour a small amount of the pasteurized milk in to a bowl and mix with the 2 tb yogurt.
1. Pour the milk-yogurt mixture back in to the pot.
1. Put the liner pot back in to the Instant Pot and seal the lid.
1. Set the Instant Pot to Yogurt, Ferment mode at "high" for 11 hours.
1. Go to bed or work.
1. When the instant pot beeps to signal it's done, open the lid carefully, as a lot of condensation will have collected on the inside of the lid.
1. Vigorously stir the yogurt with a whisk until the curds are well incorporated and it has a smooth creamy texture. <br> ![top down view of a stainless steel pot filled with white yogurt, a whisk is partially submerged in it]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.asset_path }}/img/IMG_0192.jpeg){: width="60%" display="block" }
1. Pour in to jars and refrigerate for 12-24 hours before eating. It should thicken to batter-like consistency, but it will never completely hold its shape.

### On Culture

You can use store-bought yogurt to make this, but it will only last a few generations. The cultures used in mass-market yogurt are carefully balanced to meet specific nutrition targets, but are not typically self-sustaining. If you want to keep making yogurt again and again, you can either get some heirloom yogurt from a friend to use as starter, or [buy some online](https://culturesforhealth.com/products/bulgarian-yogurt-starter). I got some from a neighbor on our local buy nothing group.

[^1]: This process can be sped up by putting the pot in a bath of ice water, but the temperature will drop very quickly. If you do this, watch the temperature very closely so it doesn't get too cold.
